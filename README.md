# ghdown
Github repository/group downloader

usage: `ghdown.py --u dex73r --o gitdex73r`   
where `--u` is user or the group you have targeted and `--o` is directory where the contents will save. ( not required by default; saves into dir with name of target if unused )   
Please keep in mind that it's my first python script, I'm pretty sure it could've been done easier.

installing requirements:   
`sudo pip install PyGithub`   
`sudo pip install requests`
